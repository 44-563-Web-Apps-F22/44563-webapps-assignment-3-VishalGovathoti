<h2>Egyptian Museum</h2>
<p>Based on the <b>artifacts inside</b>, it should rank higher. Based on the building and display of objects, it should rank lower
    The museum is in <b>Tahrir Square</b>, which was the location of the recent protests in Egypt. There has been talk of a new museum located closer to the pyramids which would be able to showcase more of the collection and would also be more secure.
